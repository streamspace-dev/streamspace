## Introduction

This template guides team retrospectives for continuous improvement. Retrospectives are held at the end of each wave to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and what to improve.

**Goals**:
- Celebrate successes
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Make actionable commitments
- Foster psychological safety

**Duration**: 60 minutes (for multi-agent waves)

## Retrospective Format: Start, Stop, Continue

### Why This Format?

- **Simple**: Easy to understand and participate
- **Actionable**: Focuses on concrete changes

## Best Practices

### Before the Retro

1. **Schedule in advance**: Block calendar at wave end
2. **Review wave goals**: Refresh on what was planned
3. **Gather metrics**: Have data ready (PRs, test coverage, velocity)
4. **Psychological safety**: Remind team this is blameless

### During the Retro

1. **Time-box strictly**: 60 minutes max (respect people's time)
2. **Equal voice**: Ensure everyone speaks (round-robin if needed)
3. **No blame**: Focus on processes, not people
4. **Action-oriented**: Every discussion should lead to action
5. **Vote on items**: Prioritize using dot voting (each person gets 3 votes)

### After the Retro

1. **Document immediately**: Capture action items in this template
2. **Share with team**: Post retro notes in team channel
3. **Track actions**: Add action items to GitHub issues or project board
4. **Follow up**: Check action item status at start of next retro
